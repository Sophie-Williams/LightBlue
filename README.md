# LightBlue

Hello and welcome to LightBlue ! LightBlue was a school project of two weeks I made in Epitech during my third year. 

The goal of this project was to implement a Gomoku Narabe game bot (also called Wuzi Qi, Slope, Darpion or Five in a Row), focusing on the performance of its artificial intelligence. My program follows the gomocup [protocol](http://gomocup.org/detail-information).

My bot is usable in the software [Pisvork](http://gomocup.org/download-gomocup-manager/).

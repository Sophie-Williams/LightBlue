# Gomoku

Hello and welcome to Gomoku ! Gomoku was a school project of two weeks I made in Epitech during my third year. 

The goal of this project was to implement a Gomoku Narabe game bot (also called Wuzi Qi, Slope, Darpion or Five in a Row), focusing on the performance of its artificial intelligence.

My bot is usable in the software [Pisvork](http://gomocup.org/piskvork/).

The graduation was done according to the rank of the AI in a championship between all the bots of the class.
